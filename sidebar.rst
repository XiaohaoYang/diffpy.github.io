DiffPy is the home of the 
`DiffPy-CMI <products/diffpycmi/index.html>`_
Complex Modeling framework, a modular software framework for robust and extensible 
modeling of diffraction data.  We welcome contributions to this project from the 
community.

The project is currently centered at `Brookhaven National Laboratory`_, a US `Department of 
Energy, Office of Basic Energy Sciences`_ funded laboratory. 
Many parts of the code were developed under the diffraction part of the DANSE_ project,
a software construction project funded by the `National Science Foundation`_ to provide 
data analysis software tools for neutron scattering experiments.  This project was previously
centered at Columbia University and, before that, Michigan State University.
